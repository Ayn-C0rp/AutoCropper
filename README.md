# AutoCropper
## Introduction
AutoCropper is an android studio application that helps crop out the post from a screenshot of a post from the instagram app. It utilizes the opencv library to achieve this. To run on android, the cropping code itself is run using the chaquopy library for Android Studio. Horribly inefficient, I know but it used to barely work. <br>
As Instagram keeps slightly updating its UI, the app itself has broken a long time ago. Furthermore most phones now come with built in AI detection to crop posts from such screenshots anyway making this project completely redundant. However, it was a really fun project to work on and let me wet my hands with both opencv and android studio.
